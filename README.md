# ***Humanoid Robot for Autism Communication Aid***


This project aims to develop a humanoid robot designed to assist children with autism in improving their communication skills. The robot interacts with the child using a combination of speech recognition, text-to-speech, servo motor movements, and visual displays on a touchscreen. The entire system is controlled by a Raspberry Pi and communicates with a mobile application using the MQTT protocol. The robot provides engaging and interactive sessions to help children practice and enhance their communication abilities in a friendly and supportive environment.



# **ðŸ”²Features**

- **Personalized Interaction:** The robot welcomes the child by name and engages them in interactive sessions.
- **Speech Recognition:** Uses state-of-the-art speech recognition technology to understand and respond to the childâ€™s spoken words.
- **Text-to-Speech:** Communicates with the child using natural-sounding speech synthesis.
- **Facial Expressions:** Displays various facial expressions on a touchscreen to enhance interaction and provide visual feedback.
- **Motor Movements:** Uses servo motors to move the robotâ€™s arms and neck, adding a physical dimension to the interaction.
- **Session Feedback:** Tracks the childâ€™s progress and sends feedback and scores to a mobile application, which suggests further activities based on performance.
- **MQTT Communication:** Ensures seamless communication between the robot and the mobile app for real-time updates and control.
